     * Prints lines from a script for a given actress (or actor).
     * <p>
     * Given a script formatted like "Rent-Excerpt.txt" and "Rent.txt", print all lines for a given
     * actress in the following format. For example, if the search term is "Roger" or "roger":
     * <pre>
     * ROGER
     * ---
     * This won't tune.
     * ---
     * Are you talking to me?
     * ---
     * I'm writing one great song --
     * ---
     * </pre>
     *
     * <p>
     * Etc. Here are the guidelines:
     * <ol>
     * <li>You should print the name of the actress capitalized first on a single line. But only
     * once.</li>
     * <li>Groups of lines are separated by "---". Put another way, once another character begins
     * speaking, print the "---" divider. Your output should also end with a "---".</li>
     * <li>Do not print unspoken stage directions: these lines start with "(".  * For example, this
     * is a stage direction:
     * <pre>
     * (He turns the camera to ROGER)
     * </pre>
     * </li>
     * <li>If you are asked to search for lines for an actress that does not exist, you should print
     * nothing: not their name, not any "---" separators.</li>
     * </ol>
     * <p>
     * Complete the Javadoc comment and write this function.
     * @param actress gives the name of the actress whose lines are searched
     * @param script gives the script to search from
